This module provides a python API to interact with an EteSync server. It
currently implements AddressBook and Calendar access, and supports
two-way sync (both push and pull) to the server. It doesn't currently
implement pushing raw journal entries which are needed for people
implementing new EteSync journal types which will be implemented soon.
