This package provides a local CalDAV and CardDAV server that proxies requests
to an EteSync server for use with desktop CalDAV and CardDAV clients.

If all you want is to access your data from a computer, you are probably better off using [the web app](https://client.etesync.com).

This is essentially a compatibility layer between EteSync and DAV clients.

This depends on the [radicale_storage_etesync](https://github.com/etesync/radicale_storage_etesync) module and the [Radicale server](http://radicale.org) for operation.

# Installation

`pip install etesync-dav`

The above should be either run as root, or better yet, inside a python "virtualenv".

## Arch Linux

The package `etesync-dav` is [available on AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/etesync-dav/).

## Windows systems

A working python3 installation is required. Python for windows is available [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows).

## Docker
Build the Docker image

    docker build . -t etesync-dav:latest

Run setup and persist configuration into a docker volume

    docker run -it --rm -v etesync:/data etesync-dav:latest setup

Run etesync-dav server in background

    docker run --name etesync-dav -d -v etesync:/data -p 37358:37358 --restart=always etesync-dav:latest

# Configuration and running

If you are self-hosting the EteSync server, you will need to set the
`ETESYNC_URL` environment variable to the URL of your server. By default it
uses the official EteSync server at `https://api.etesync.com`. The commands
below all use this environment variable to determine which server to
connect to.

You need to first add an EteSync user using `etesync-dav-manage`, for example:

`etesync-dav-manage add me@etesync.com`

*On Windows systems, you may have to navigate to the location of the python script etesync-dav-manage.py (e.g. C:\Python\Python36\Scripts) and run*

`python etesync-dav-manage add me@etesync.com`

*Substitute “`me@etesync.com`” with the username or email you use with your
EteSync account or self-hosted server.*

and then run the server:
`etesync-dav`

*On Windows systems, you may have to navigate to the location of the etesync-dav.py script and run*

`python etesync-dav`

*Please note that some antivirus/internet security software may block the CalDAV/CardDAV service from running - make sure that etesync-dav is whitelisted.*

After this, set up your CalDAV/CardDAV client to use the username and password
you got from `etesync-dav-manage`, or alternatively run:
`etesync-dav-manage get me@etesync.com` to get them again.

Depending on the client you use, the server path should either be:

* `http://localhost:37358/`
* `http://localhost:37358/me@etesync.com/`

On most clients this should automatically detect your collections (i.e.
calendars and address books).

If your client does not automatically detect your collections, you will
need to manually add them. You need to find the “collection URL” for each
collection you want to add. Currently, the simplest way to do this is to
log in to the web interface provided by the internal Radicale server. Just
open [http://localhost:37358/](http://localhost:37358/) in your browser (or
substitute “localhost” for the hostname or IP address of the etesync-dav
instance). Then you will need to log in using the username and password
given by the `etesync-dav-manage` tool as described above (run `etesync-dav-manage
get me@etesync.com` to get them again). The Radicale web interface shows
the collections with their names and URLs. You can just copy and paste the
URLs into your client. You will most likely also need to manually copy and
paste the collection names as well, and select a color manually.

Alternative ways to get collection URLs include programmatically using the
`pyetesync` module (see
[example.py](https://github.com/etesync/pyetesync/blob/master/example.py)
for example usage), or copy it from the debug page in the EteSync Android
app. When using `example.py`, the EteSync server address that should be
used is `https://api.etesync.com` when interacting with the production
server.


## Config files

`etesync-dav` stores data in the directory specified by the `CONFIG_DIR`
environment variable. This includes a database, credentials, and Radicale
configuration file. This directory is not relocatable, so if you change
`CONFIG_DIR` you will need to regenerate these files (which means
reconfiguring clients). It may be possible to manually edit these files to
the new path. Note that the database will just mirror the content of your
main EteSync database so in most cases you should not lose anything if you
delete it.

`CONFIG_DIR` defaults to a subdirectory of the appropriate config directory
for your platform (`~/.config/etesync-dav` on Unix/Linux, see
[appdirs](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/appdirs) module docs for where it
will be on other platforms).

be set to v4.0 when prompted
    * CalDAV: Only works when providing full collection path.
        * Requires the

# Known issues

* This package is missing startups script for automatic execution on startup.
* Due to an issue with one of the dependencies, some contacts, namely groups, will sometimes fail to work. Revelant PR: https://github.com/eventable/vobject/pull/77
