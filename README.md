This package provides a local CalDAV and CardDAV server that acts as an EteSync compatibility layer (adapter).
It's meant for letting desktop CalDAV and CardDAV clients such as Thunderbird, Outlook and Apple Contacts connect with EteSync.

If all you want is to access your data from a computer, you are probably better off using [the web app](https://client.etesync.com).

**Note:** This software is still in beta. It should work well and is used daily by many users, but there may be some rough edges.

# Installation

The easiest way to start using etesync-dav is by getting one of the pre-built binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/etesync/etesync-dav/releases).

These binaries are self-contained and can be run as-is, though they do not start automatically on boot. You'd need to either start them manually, or set up autostart based on your OS.

**Note:** For Linux and Mac you may want to rename the binaries to `etesync-dav` for ease of use.

# Configuration and running

If you are self-hosting the EteSync server, you will need to set the
`ETESYNC_URL` environment variable to the URL of your server. By default it
uses the official EteSync server at `https://api.etesync.com`. The commands
below all use this environment variable to determine which server to
connect to.

You need to first add an EteSync user using `etesync-dav manage`, for example:

`etesync-dav manage add user@example.com`

*Substitute “`user@example.com`” with the username or email you use with your
EteSync account or self-hosted server.*

and then run the server:
`etesync-dav`

*Please note that some antivirus/internet security software may block the CalDAV/CardDAV service from running - make sure that etesync-dav is whitelisted.*

## Setting up clients

After this, set up your CalDAV/CardDAV client to use the username and password
you got from when adding your account to EteSync DAV before, or alternatively run
`etesync-dav manage get user@example.com` to get them again.

Depending on the client you use, the server path should either be:

* `http://localhost:37358/`
* `http://localhost:37358/user@example.com/`

On most clients this should automatically detect your collections (i.e.
calendars and address books).

If your client does not automatically detect your collections, you will
need to manually add them. You need to find the “collection URL” for each
collection you want to add. Currently, the simplest way to do this is to
log in to the web interface provided by the internal Radicale server. Just
open [http://localhost:37358/](http://localhost:37358/) in your browser (or
substitute “localhost” for the hostname or IP address of the etesync-dav
instance). Then you will need to log in using the username and password
given by the `etesync-dav manage` tool as described above (run `etesync-dav manage
get user@example.com` to get them again). The Radicale web interface shows
the collections with their names and URLs. You can just copy and paste the
URLs into your client. You will most likely also need to manually copy and
paste the collection names as well, and select a color manually.

## macOS Mojave

macOS Mojave enforces the use of SSL, *regardless* of whether you enable the
checkbox for SSL or not. So to use EteSync, you have to enable SSL.

You can do so by either using the `etesync-dav-certgen` utility, or follow
the instructions below. Following these instructions will generate a self-signed SSL certificate,
configure etesync-dav to use that certificate, and make your system trust it.

### Automatic SSL setup

You can automatically setup SSL by running the following command:

    etesync-dav-certgen --trust-cert

You will be prompted for your login password. This is because `--trust-cert`
imports the certificate into your login keychain and then instructs the
system to trust it for SSL connections.

Once you have run `etesync-dav-certgen`, you need to restart `etesync-dav`
for the changes to take effect. Then proceed to configure CalDAV and CardDAV
as described above.

If you have already configured `etesync-dav` to use SSL, 
`etesync-dav-certgen` will use your existing settings; in won't
reconfigure `etesync-dav`. It also won't overwrite existing
certificates. `--trust-cert` works on macOS 10.3 or newer only.
See `etesync-dav-certgen --help` for details.

### Manual SSL setup

Alternatively you can generate and configure a self-signed certificate manually with the following steps:

1. Generate a self-signed certificate (valid for 10 years)

````bash
cd "~/Library/Application Support/etesync-dav"
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 3650 -nodes -x509 -subj "/C=US/ST=Denial/L=Springfield/O=Dis/CN=etesync.localhost" -keyout etesync.key -out etesync.crt
````
    
2. Using `open` command triggers macOS "add to keychain" dialog (equivelent of double-clicking that file in Finder):

````bash
open etesync.crt
````
    
3. In the dialog confirm adding to "login" keychain.
4. Open `Keychain Access` app, find and open `etesync.localhost` (under Keychains: login, Category: Certificates), expand "Trust" and pick "Always trust" for SSL. 
5. Edit `~/Library/Application Support/etesync-dav/radicale.conf`, under `[server]` enter the following to make it use the certificate:

````ini
    ssl = yes
    certificate = ~/Library/Application Support/etesync-dav/etesync.crt
    key = ~/Library/Application Support/etesync-dav/etesync.key
````

6. Restart `etesync-dav`

### SSL in non-macOS applications

Some applications, above all, web browers (Firefox, Chrome, ...) manage certificates themselves, rather than relying on the mechanisms the operating system provides. But `etesync-dav-certgen` and the instructions above only make the operating system trust the self-signed certificate. If you want to use SSL to connect to `etesync-dav` using such applications, you need to make them trust the self-signed certificate.


## iOS

By default, iOS only syncs events 30 days old and newer, which may look as if
events are not showing. To fix this, got to: Settings -> Calendar -> Sync and
change to the wanted time duration.


# Alternative Installation Methods

This methods are not as easy as the pre-built binaries method above, but are also simple. Please follow the instructions below, following which follow the instructions in the [Configuration and running](#configuration-and-running) section below.

## Docker

Run one time initial setup to persist the required configuration into a docker volume. Check out the configuration section below for more information.

    docker run -it --rm -v etesync-dav:/data etesync/etesync-dav manage add USER_EMAIL

Run etesync-dav in a background docker container with configuration from previous step (this is the command you'd run every time)

    docker run --name etesync-dav -d -v etesync-dav:/data -p 37358:37358 --restart=always etesync/etesync-dav
    
After this, refer to the [Setting up clients](#setting-up-clients) section below and start using it!

### Updating

To update to the latest version of the docker image, run:

    docker pull etesync/etesync-dav

### Note for self-hosting:

If you're self-hosting the EteSync server, you will need to add the following before the `-v` in the above commands:

    --env "ETESYNC_URL=https://your-etesync-url.com"
    
        
## Arch Linux

The package `etesync-dav` is [available on AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/etesync-dav/).

## Windows systems

You can either follow the Docker instructions above (get Docker [here](https://www.docker.com)), or alternatively install Python3 for windows from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows).

## Python virtual environment (Linux, BSD and Mac)

Install virtual env (for **Python 3**) from your package manager, for example:

- Arch Linux: pacman -S python-virtualenv
- Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install python3-virtualenv

The bellow commands will install etesync to a directory called `venv` in the local path. To install to a different location, just choose a different path in the commands below.

Set up the virtual env:

    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install etesync-dav

Run the etesync commands as explained in the [Configuration and running](#configuration-and-running) section:

    ./venv/bin/etesync-dav manage ...
    ./venv/bin/etesync-dav ...

Please note that you'll have to run `source venv/bin/activate` every time you'd like to run the EteSync commands.

# Advanced configuration

## Config files

`etesync-dav` stores data in the directory specified by the `CONFIG_DIR`
environment variable. This includes a database, credentials, and Radicale
configuration file. This directory is not relocatable, so if you change
`CONFIG_DIR` you will need to regenerate these files (which means
reconfiguring clients). It may be possible to manually edit these files to
the new path. Note that the database will just mirror the content of your
main EteSync database so in most cases you should not lose anything if you
delete it.

`CONFIG_DIR` defaults to a subdirectory of the appropriate config directory
for your platform (`~/.config/etesync-dav` on Unix/Linux, see
[appdirs](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/appdirs) module docs for where it
will be on other platforms).

# Credits

This depends on the [radicale_storage_etesync](https://github.com/etesync/radicale_storage_etesync) module and the [Radicale server](http://radicale.org) for operation.
